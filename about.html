                <p>"Don't work for money - you never make enough money. And never just because you want to be famous - you never feel like you're famous enough. and work hard in the hope that people will notice and love those gifts. " That is one of the things that I love very much that writer John Green once wrote.</p>
                <p>With the mission of beautifying everyone, I wish the girls who receive the gift from dermond will be confident, beautiful and proud because when creating each shirt or dress, I not only consider it a real product. The product is also a work of medicine woven from passion, so Dermond's items unfortunately are massively processed in numbers, which are carefully selected from fabric materials, to small things like toughness. the shade of the thread, the color of each button or the buckle of the skirt. After that, meticulous measurements were carried out and each one checked manually before reaching the hands of users.</p>

                <h1>Mate<span>rial</span></h1>
                <p>Charmeuse is a fabric that is soft in contact with the skin, its surface is lustrous, luxurious, and has a graceful luster without the fear of objectionable heaviness.</p>
                <p>The luster of Charmeuse is considered to be the ultimate, capturing beautiful light like a flowing water smoothly under sunlight.</p>
                <p>This is a luxury fabric that was loved for decades, in the 14th century it was popular across Europe for the aristocracy, the church and the upper class.</p>

                <p>Arts and Beauty harmonize. And the harmonization is to be found at the Artist.</p>
                <p>Beauty comes in many forms to represent Arts: paintings, garments, melodies, infrastructures... Indeed, Beauty can be found by the naked eyes. But the true Beauty takes more effort to be seen and sensed.</p>
                <p>True Beauty, or should I say Arts, exhibits itself WHEN the Artist creates, masters, and operates the world with their creations and a kind heart.</p>
                <p>Dermond's outfits will be increasingly perfect, developing towards the new, innovative, dynamic and confident for Dermond's girls, so we hope to receive a lot of support and attention to can share with you our little passions.</p>
